the code is written in c++, no needed extra libraries to be installed.

to run the assembler, just put your file name without (.txt), run the code, then the assembler will generate a file called "(your input) assembled file.txt" that
 will has the assembled binary code.

note that, any written number in your code is in HEX format and the assembled code will be binary.

the code here will output file with binary code only, no 1=> , 2=> and so on.

if you want to see it by 1 => ... and so on (for viewing only), run the .exe in folder "for view only".
